Your weight doesn't tell the whole story. Body fat percentage is what actually matters for health, fitness, and performance — and most apps only give you one rough estimate.

Body Fat Calculator gives you 9 different scientifically-validated formulas so you can cross-reference results and get the most accurate picture of your body composition.

THREE FREE METHODS
- YMCA — quick estimate using weight and waist
- Modified YMCA — improved accuracy with additional measurements
- U.S. Navy — the same formula used by the military to assess fitness

SIX PRO METHODS
- Jackson & Pollock 3-Site, 4-Site, and 7-Site — the industry standard for skinfold testing
- Durnin & Womersley — clinical gold standard used in exercise science research
- Covert Bailey — comprehensive method using multiple circumference sites
- Parrillo 9-Site — the most detailed method, designed for bodybuilders and athletes

Every formula is implemented directly from peer-reviewed research with documented accuracy ranges (±3–7% depending on method and technique).
