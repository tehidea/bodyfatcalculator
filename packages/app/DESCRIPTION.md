# Scientific Body Fat Calculator

The most comprehensive body fat calculation tool implementing research-validated formulas including Jackson & Pollock (3-site, 4-site, 7-site), Durnin & Womersley, YMCA, Modified YMCA, U.S. Navy, Parrillo, and Covert Bailey methods.

## Calculation Methods & Accuracy

### Free Methods

**YMCA Method** (±5-7% accuracy)

- Simple method using weight and waist measurements
- Higher margin of error due to minimal measurements
- Best for tracking personal trends rather than absolute values
- Less accurate for athletic or non-standard body types

**Modified YMCA** (±4-6% accuracy)

- Enhanced version with additional measurements for women
- Improved accuracy over basic YMCA
- More reliable for women due to gender-specific calculations
- Still affected by non-standard fat distribution

**U.S. Navy Method** (±4-6% accuracy)

- Military standard using key body measurements
- Most accurate for individuals near population averages
- Less reliable for very lean (under 8%) or obese (over 30%) individuals
- Accuracy depends heavily on measurement technique

### PRO Methods (One-Time Purchase)

**Covert Bailey** (±4-5% accuracy)

- Comprehensive method with multiple measurements
- Age and gender-specific calculations
- More reliable across different body types
- Requires precise measurement technique

**Durnin & Womersley** (±3.5-5% accuracy)

- Scientific skinfold method
- Age and gender-specific equations
- Accuracy heavily dependent on technician skill
- Requires proper caliper technique and calibration

**Jackson & Pollock Methods**

- 3-Site (±4-5% accuracy)
- 4-Site (±3.5-4.5% accuracy)
- 7-Site (±3-4% accuracy)
- Industry standard for skinfold measurements
- Accuracy improves with more measurement sites
- Requires significant technical expertise

**Parrillo 9-Site** (±3-4% accuracy)

- Bodybuilding-focused nine-site method
- Most comprehensive skinfold method
- Requires significant expertise and consistent technique
- Best for tracking changes in trained individuals
